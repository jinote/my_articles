__Training and Testing Data Sets__

__Summary__

* Separating data into training and testing sets is an important part of evaluating data mining models.
* when you seperate a data set into a training set and testing set, most of the data is used for training, and a smaller portion of the data is used for testing.
* Analysis services randomly samples the data to help ensure that the testing and training sets are similar
* By using similar data for training and testing, you can minimize the effects of data discrepancies and better understand the characteristics of the model.
* After a model has been processed by using the training set, you test the model by making predictions against the test set.
* The data in the testing set already contains known values for the attribute that you want to predict, it is easy to determine whether the model's gusses are correct
