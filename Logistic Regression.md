Linear Regression and Logistic Regression are the two famous Machine Learning Algorithms which come under supervised learning technique. 
Since both the algorithms are of supervised in nature hence these algorithms use labeled dataset to make the predictions. 
But the main difference between them is how they are being used. 
The Linear Regression is used for solving "Regression" problems whereas Logistic Regression is used for solving the "Classification" problems. 
The description of both the algorithms is given below along with difference table.


__* Logistic Regression:__

* Logistic regression is one of the most popular Machine learning algorithm that comes under __Supervised Learning techniques.__

* It can be used for __Classification__ as well as for Regression problems, but mainly used for Classification problems.

* Logistic regression is used to __predict the categorical dependent variable__ with the help of independent variables.

* The output of Logistic Regression problem can be __only between the 0 and 1.__

* __Logistic regression can be used where the probabilities between two classes is required.__ Such as whether it will rain today or not, either 0 or 1, true or false etc.

* Logistic regression is based on the concept of __Maximum Likelihood estimation.__ According to this estimation, the observed data should be most probable.

* In logistic regression, we pass the weighted sum of inputs through an activation function that can map values in between 0 and 1. Such activation function is known as sigmoid function and the curve obtained is called as sigmoid curve or S-curve.
