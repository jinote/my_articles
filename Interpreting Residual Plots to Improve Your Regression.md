__Interpreting Residual Plots to Improve Your Regression__

__Summary_

* Use the observed, predicted, and residual values to assess and improve the model.
* Residual = Observed – Predicted
* positive values for the residual (on the y-axis) mean the prediction was too low, and negative values mean the prediction was too high; 
  0 means the guess was exactly correct.
